# ```bakalari-token```
## A simple binary to retrieve your refresh token from the Bakaláři school system. 
This is not actively maintained right now, my focus has shifted to other parts of IoT like the Arduino boards. That does not mean I am completely abandoning this project (hence the non-read-only state of the repo) and I might build on this base and even create an actual interface library.

## Usage
* Execute
* Input login details _(this is safe, no third-party communication is performed)_
* Profit!

## Contributing
Make changes and start a PR. If I like it, I will merge it and your name will appear in the README! (I know, big honor to be listed in a high school student's half-assed rust project)
